# Motia Uptime Monitor - Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and update the values according to your setup

# ==============================================
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================

# List of websites to monitor (JSON array format)
# Add all the URLs you want to monitor for uptime
# Each URL should be a complete HTTP/HTTPS URL
SITES=["https://example.com", "https://google.com", "https://github.com"]

# ==============================================
# OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================

# Cron expression for check frequency
# Default: */1 * * * * (every minute)
# Examples:
#   */30 * * * * = every 30 seconds
#   */5 * * * *  = every 5 minutes
#   0 */2 * * *  = every 2 hours
CHECK_INTERVAL_CRON=*/1 * * * *

# Alert rate limiting configuration
# Maximum number of alerts allowed within the time window
# Default: 3
ALERT_BURST=3

# Time window for alert rate limiting (in seconds)
# Default: 300 (5 minutes)
# This prevents notification spam by limiting alerts per site
ALERT_WINDOW_SEC=300

# Number of retry attempts on failure
# Default: 1
# Set to 0 to disable retries, higher values for more resilience
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=1

# Request timeout in milliseconds
# Default: 10000 (10 seconds)
# Adjust based on your network conditions and site response times
TIMEOUT_MS=10000

# Whether to validate SSL certificates
# Default: false
# Set to true to enable strict SSL certificate validation
CHECK_CERTIFICATES=false

# ==============================================
# ADDITIONAL NOTES
# ==============================================

# SITES Configuration Tips:
# - Use complete URLs including protocol (http:// or https://)
# - Each site in the array should be quoted
# - Separate multiple sites with commas
# - Example with multiple sites:
#   SITES=["https://mysite.com", "https://api.mysite.com/health", "https://blog.mysite.com"]

# CRON Expression Format:
# ┌───────────── second (0-59)
# │ ┌─────────── minute (0-59)
# │ │ ┌───────── hour (0-23)
# │ │ │ ┌─────── day of month (1-31)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───── month (1-12)
# │ │ │ │ │ ┌─── day of week (0-7, Sunday=0 or 7)
# │ │ │ │ │ │

# Terminal Logging Features:
# The monitor displays status changes with colored output in your terminal:
# - 🟢 Green for UP status with success indicators
# - 🔴 Red for DOWN status with error details
# - ✅ Checkmarks for regular status updates
# - 🚨 Alert banners for status changes
# - ⏱️ Response time and timestamp information

# Rate Limiting Explanation:
# ALERT_BURST=3 and ALERT_WINDOW_SEC=300 means:
# - Maximum 3 alerts per site within 5 minutes
# - After 3 alerts, further alerts are blocked until the window resets
# - This prevents notification spam during extended outages
# - Rate limited alerts show countdown until next alert is available

# Performance Tuning:
# - Lower CHECK_INTERVAL_CRON for faster detection (higher resource usage)
# - Increase TIMEOUT_MS for slow sites or poor network conditions
# - Adjust RETRY_ATTEMPTS based on your tolerance for false positives
# - Enable CHECK_CERTIFICATES for production environments with valid SSL

# Security Considerations:
# - Keep your .env file private and never commit it to version control
# - Use environment-specific values (dev/staging/production)
# - Monitor terminal output for unauthorized access patterns
# - Consider log rotation for long-running monitoring sessions
